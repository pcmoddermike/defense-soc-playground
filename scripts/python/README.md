# Python SOC Utilities

This directory contains small Python utilities intended to support SOC and detection engineering workflows.

## Purpose
- Event enrichment and normalization
- Decoding or deobfuscation tasks
- Detection support tooling
- Workflow automation for analysis tasks

## Design Principles
- Tools are small, focused, and readable
- Scripts prioritize clarity over cleverness
- Utilities are designed to support detections, not replace them

## Notes
These scripts are not intended to be full production tools, but rather practical examples of automation commonly used in SOC environments.
