# Defense SOC Playground

This repository contains hands-on defensive security projects focused on modern SOC workflows, detection engineering, and security automation.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate practical, real-world defensive security skills through detection logic, analysis, and small supporting tools — not to serve as a collection of copied rules or certifications.

## Objectives
- Design and document practical security detections
- Explore alert logic, false positives, and tuning considerations
- Translate attacker techniques into actionable detection strategies
- Build small automation utilities that support SOC operations
