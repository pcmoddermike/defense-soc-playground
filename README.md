# Defense SOC Playground

This repository contains hands-on defensive security projects focused on modern SOC workflows, detection engineering, and security automation using Microsoft-centric telemetry and KQL.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate real-world detection engineering skills through clear alert logic, investigation context, and supporting automation — not to act as a collection of copied rules or certifications.

## Objectives
- Design and document practical KQL-based security detections
- Translate attacker techniques into actionable detection logic
- Analyze false positives and tuning opportunities
- Build small Python utilities that support SOC workflows

## Repository Structure

detections/kql/ # KQL detection queries and documentation

scripts/python/ # Automation and enrichment tools

## Detection Philosophy
- Detections prioritize signal quality over alert volume
- Assumptions and log dependencies are documented
- Each detection aligns to MITRE ATT&CK techniques
- Queries are written to be understandable and explainable
