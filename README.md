# KQL Detections

This directory contains Kusto Query Language (KQL) detections designed for SOC and detection engineering use cases.

## Focus Areas
- Endpoint and process-based detections
- PowerShell and script execution monitoring
- Living-off-the-Land (LOLBins) abuse
- Alert logic tuning and false positive reduction

## Notes
These detections assume common Microsoft Defender and Sentinel-style telemetry and are intended to demonstrate detection logic rather than environment-specific configurations.
